title: 'ONOS: denial-of-service (DoS) due to exception handling while deserializing jumbo frames'

description: 'It was found that the packet deserializers in ONOS would throw exceptions when handling malformed, truncated or maliciously-crafted packets. The exceptions were not caught and handled, which would result in the relevant switch being disconnected because an exception occurred in an I/O thread. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by causing ONOS to disconnect switches.'
