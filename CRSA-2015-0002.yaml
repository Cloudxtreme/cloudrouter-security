title: 'OpenDaylight openflowplugin allows topology spoofing via host tracking'

description: 'It has been reported that it is possible for an attacker to spoof
  network topology via host tracking. An attacker can abuse host tracking by updating
  the host location information without any validation, authentication or
  authorization. This makes it possible to impersonate other network devices by
  obtaining their MAC address. This issue is related to well-known MAC spoofing
  attacks. Further technical details are available in a conference paper.'
